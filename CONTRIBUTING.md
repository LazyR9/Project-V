# How to Contribute
If you want to make a contribution, such as adding art, design levels, or improving code,
follow these steps to get started.
## Requirements
* A GitHub account
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
## Step 1 - Download the project
When you are signed in your GitHub and on the repo page, hit the `Fork` button in the top right to make a copy in your account.
Then, using GitHub Desktop, clone **your** repo to your computer, **NOT** the original.
If you're making changes to assets or the script, import the project into Unity Hub by clicking `Add`,
then choosing the folder **in** the repo, **NOT** the repo folder itself.
## Step 2 - Make the Changes
If you're contributing art, change the art, **BUT NOT** the file name if possible,
this will make implementing your art easier.
If you changed the code, make sure it is **properly commented**,
so anyone else viewing it knows what is going on, without having to look up your PR.
## Step 3 - Open the Pull Request
Go to your GitHub Desktop client, commit and push your changes,
and go to the original project page and hit `Pull Request`.
Fill the Pull Request template, apply the appropriate tags, and then press `Create New Pull Request`.
# Done!
And that's it! We well review your request and may respond with question/concerns before accepting or denying your request.
Also, the process is similar for other repos, you just need to read their rules before opening a Pull Request.
We look forward to your contributions!

# Project V
Project V is the code name for the game I'm working on, it was suggested on my Discord server in Febuary,
and I've been working on it off and on ever since.
The main concept is that you are an anti-virus program in a computer trying to stop virus,
and you use a console to do various tasks to help you complete each level.

## FAQ
### Why is this on GitHub?
It allows you to download it and modify it, if you know how to use the Unity game engine.
I am also using it to collaborate instead of using Unity's collab system, because it has restrictions.
Also, if you want to contribute, you can open a pull request, so then this can sort-of be a community game.
### When will it come out?
I have no currently planned release date, however I do hope to release it before Fall 2022;
I don't know how long this will take, and it is still **VERY** early in development.
### How will I download it when it comes out?
I will have an installer available under the releases page when it comes out, and maybe a test build for playtesting every now and then.
